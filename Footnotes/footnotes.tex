\fn{2-1}{See, eg, Brian T. Detweiler, `May It Please the Court: A Longitudinal Study of Judicial Citation to Academic Legal Periodicals' (2020) 39(2) \textit{Legal Reference Services Quarterly} 87, 114-8. Detwiler uses a variety of wildcard searches in Lexis as a basic method for extracting journal articles from judgments. Joshua D. Baker, `Relics or Relevant: The Value of the Modern Law Review' (2009) 111(3) \textit{West Virginia Law Review} 919, 928. Finding a noticeable decrease in the number of citations between 1971 to 1998. Baker also finds prestigious law journals to be cited more frequently. David L. Schwartz and Lee Petherbridge, `The Use of Legal Scholarship by the Federal Courts of Appeals: An Empirical Study' (2011) 96(6) \textit{Cornell Law Review} 1345, 1361. Contrary to Baker, Schwartz and Lee found an increase in the number of citations to law journals between 1950 and 2008. This divergence in outcome lends credibility to legal commentators who see these scientometric studies as unfit for purpose. Richard G. Kopf, `Do Judges Read the Review - A Citation-Counting Study of the Nebraska Law Review and the Nebraska Supreme Court, 1972-1996' (1997) 76 \textit{Nebraska Law Review} 708, 717, 719-20. Former District Court Judge Kopf formulates a test for determining the qualitative impact of a citation by evaluating whether the relying paragraph directly mentions or follows the citation. On this method, see also Xiaodan Zhu et al., `Measuring academic influence: Not all citations are equal' (2014) 66(2) \textit{Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology} 408, 413.}
